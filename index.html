      <h3><b>Interest in IT</b></h3>
    </div>
    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>I first became interested in I.T. tvery early in primary school when our IT teacher stimulated my interest with his passion for computer projects. 
Our first project was a traffic light system automatically turning on and off traffic lights in order. Its probably super easy although i would have no idea how to do it now. 
His passion for IT was inspiring and stimulated my passion, i love anything electronic and techy. Since then i have had a strong interest in any tech. </p>

      <p>The job Salesforce Business Analysts is appealing to me for the following reasons. 
I know salesforce to be a market leader, their company would be a great company to work for and the possibilites are strong with such a hugely successfull and profitable company. 
This particular job i feel fits me as its to do with the things i love. IT, Business and IT. I have been hugely involved with Childcare with my own children so the systems would not be foreign to me. In very short they are looking for someone who can analys current proceedures progress them into less time heavy tasks. 
This will enable their staff and clients a smoother opertation and cheaper business model as staff have more time. Ideal candidate in my own words is somone who can chop time heavy tasks into automated streamline tasks with the use of IT, with the idea of further development in mind to grow on from your tasks and development. 
As mentioned above, the company itself is a top company to work for. The other things that make this job appealling to me personally is the requirments meet my interests, i love progressing businesses and the world of children is something i am passionate about. I feel this position is ideal for me with more experience of course, as it combines all my passions. 
This job requires MIn of 5 years of experience in large scale companies in a similar position. General knowledgeof their CRM systems and cloud based software. 
Good relation management skills, Highly accurate and advanced documents detailing the present and ideal future structures, IT transformation software and programs. 
Unfortunately i do not posess the current skills required although my strengths that are close are, Business management and client relations, thorough understanding of several child care programs and systems from an end user. Docuement and presentation skills. 
This course will assit me gain the basic skills, although i will need to obtain specialty courses in the following studies AGILE, SCRUM & Salesforce the LIghtning Platform. I would do this by obtaining selected modules and specific courses, probably inhouse courses for Salesforce CRM which i assume will be a breaze when i have this general IT knowlage under my belt. </p>.</p>
