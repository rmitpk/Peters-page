<p> The results mean for me i can take a look inside my personality, it is goodo for not just potential employers to know me and my personality but for me to understand who i am. Understanding myself wether in personal business or learning situations is valuable in mainatining control and being aware of my potential flaws. </P>

<p> The results influence my behaivior in a team by bringing my attention to my behaviours and likely responses to other personalities. By identifying my strengths and weaknesses i can see what area of the team i should be in, e.g. if i should be a leader and take charge or am i better to sit back and observe more. It definatley helps with conflict resolution or at least avoidance, knowing i may not be assertive enough, like in my case. 
The tests show me i should speak up more and not sit on my hands. If i feel or see something i dont agree with i should be aware i am a go with the tide guy and i need to action. 

I should take this into account when forming a team by finding alternative people who are strong where i am week and or opposing strengths, so we can have a even strong team. If we all have the same strengths there are many gaps in our team, if there is someone better at certain traits they should be in the position to use them. 

You are to write a report of around 1000 words describing your IT project idea. You should describe the project itself, as well as why you think it is important or interesting, and any potential drawbacks or obstacles you anticipate.
What are you passionate about? What kind of IT innovation would you like to see? What project will help you develop the skills, experience and knowledge required to make you qualified for your ideal job?
You need not have full answers to any of these questions, but you are required to have some ideas about an IT project that you think will address at least one of these questions. It may not be possible to find one that answers all three, but it is quite likely that something you would find interesting or useful will have a similar effect on others.
There are several possible types of projects that you may consider. Some potential ideas are below; others will be discussed in the following weeks:
• Developing a game using tools such as Unity, Construct2 or Cocos2d.
• Developing a smartphone app, using whatever programming language in which you have expertise, or by using tools
such as MIT App Inventor.
• Finding an innovative application for new hardware developments, such as Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys,
small robots or related technologies.
• Creating a FAQ and implementing it as a chatterbot, possibly involving speech-to-text and text-to-speech software.
• Building an electronic artefact such as a model for Minecraft or similar games, along the lines of the United Nations Block
by Block project.
This should not only describe what the project would be, but also why you think it is important or interesting, and what potential drawbacks or obstacles you anticipate.
The project idea that you put forward should have elements of originality and innovation, it does not have to be re- inventing the wheel - but isn’t to be cloning an existing product or service and doing a minor change.
Note: There are to be significant tangible artifacts towards the project completion that are delivered by the submission of ASSIGNMENT 3, so keep this in mind when brainstorming your IT Project Idea – Feasibility is a key factor.
There isn’t a set expectation of complexity to the project you select and explore, and it doesn’t necessarily have to be something commercially viable, but, perhaps aiming for such could help you settle certain questions or help form your own (and tutors/graders) perspectives towards it.
Your description should include the following sections. The word counts below are recommendations only not absolutes but are a good guide of a minimum.
Overview (100 words) - This should be a summary of what the project will be.
Motivation (100) words) - This should be a description of why the project will be interesting or useful. This may include statistics or other evidence, such as: "There
service. are 1.5 billion cat owners in Australia, and so there is a huge market for an automated cat feeder. Using Raspberry Pi technology is a cheap and easily assembled solution to this problem."
Description (500 words) - Detailed description of the features of the product or service
Tools and Technologies (100) words) - Describe the software, hardware and/or other equipment needed. Include
any relevant open source tools as appropriate.
Skills Required (100 words) - List the skills are required for your project, including software that needs to be written, and special hardware (if any). How feasible will it be to find the skills, software and hardware required?
Outcome (100  words) - If the project is successful, what will be the outcome? How will the original problem be solved? What impact will this development have?</p>
