      <p>I first became interested in I.T. tvery early in primary school when our IT teacher stimulated my interest with his passion for computer projects. 
Our first project was a traffic light system automatically turning on and off traffic lights in order. Its probably super easy although i would have no idea how to do it now. 
His passion for IT was inspiring and stimulated my passion, i love anything electronic and techy. Since then i have had a strong interest in any tech. </p>

      <p>I joined this course with no prior knowledge, i took this course to gain a general knowledge of the I.T. Industry, Although this is the Intro module i wish to proceed to the full IT course. In that 
course i wish to obtain a broud but general knowlage of the majority field of IT. I beleive that course is not super focused in one specialty so i will understandad the roots of IT upon completion..</p>

      <p>The job Salesforce Business Analysts is appealing to me for the following reasons. 
I know salesforce to be a market leader, their company would be a great company to work for and the possibilites are strong with such a hugely successfull and profitable company. 
This particular job i feel fits me as its to do with the things i love. IT, Business and IT. I have been hugely involved with Childcare with my own children so the systems would not be foreign to me. In very short they are looking for someone who can analys current proceedures progress them into less time heavy tasks. 
This will enable their staff and clients a smoother opertation and cheaper business model as staff have more time. Ideal candidate in my own words is somone who can chop time heavy tasks into automated streamline tasks with the use of IT, with the idea of further development in mind to grow on from your tasks and development. 
As mentioned above, the company itself is a top company to work for. The other things that make this job appealling to me personally is the requirments meet my interests, i love progressing businesses and the world of children is something i am passionate about. I feel this position is ideal for me with more experience of course, as it combines all my passions. 
This job requires MIn of 5 years of experience in large scale companies in a similar position. General knowledgeof their CRM systems and cloud based software. 
Good relation management skills, Highly accurate and advanced documents detailing the present and ideal future structures, IT transformation software and programs. 
Unfortunately i do not posess the current skills required although my strengths that are close are, Business management and client relations, thorough understanding of several child care programs and systems from an end user. Docuement and presentation skills. 
This course will assit me gain the basic skills, although i will need to obtain specialty courses in the following studies AGILE, SCRUM & Salesforce the LIghtning Platform. I would do this by obtaining selected modules and specific courses, probably inhouse courses for Salesforce CRM which i assume will be a breaze when i have this general IT knowlage under my belt. </p>

<p> The Big Five Test - <a href=" https://www.understandmyself.com/Contents/Item/Display/1437866" target=>The BIg Five Test Link</a> </p>


<p> The results mean for me i can take a look inside my personality, it is goodo for not just potential employers to know me and my personality but for me to understand who i am. Understanding myself wether in personal business or learning situations is valuable in mainatining control and being aware of my potential flaws. </P>

<p> The results influence my behaivior in a team by bringing my attention to my behaviours and likely responses to other personalities. By identifying my strengths and weaknesses i can see what area of the team i should be in, e.g. if i should be a leader and take charge or am i better to sit back and observe more. It definatley helps with conflict resolution or at least avoidance, knowing i may not be assertive enough, like in my case. 
The tests show me i should speak up more and not sit on my hands. If i feel or see something i dont agree with i should be aware i am a go with the tide guy and i need to action. 

I should take this into account when forming a team by finding alternative people who are strong where i am week and or opposing strengths, so we can have a even strong team. If we all have the same strengths there are many gaps in our team, if there is someone better at certain traits they should be in the position to use them. 

You are to write a report of around 1000 words describing your IT project idea. You should describe the project itself, as well as why you think it is important or interesting, and any potential drawbacks or obstacles you anticipate.
What are you passionate about? What kind of IT innovation would you like to see? What project will help you develop the skills, experience and knowledge required to make you qualified for your ideal job?
You need not have full answers to any of these questions, but you are required to have some ideas about an IT project that you think will address at least one of these questions. It may not be possible to find one that answers all three, but it is quite likely that something you would find interesting or useful will have a similar effect on others.
There are several possible types of projects that you may consider. Some potential ideas are below; others will be discussed in the following weeks:
• Developing a game using tools such as Unity, Construct2 or Cocos2d.
• Developing a smartphone app, using whatever programming language in which you have expertise, or by using tools
such as MIT App Inventor.
• Finding an innovative application for new hardware developments, such as Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys,
small robots or related technologies.
• Creating a FAQ and implementing it as a chatterbot, possibly involving speech-to-text and text-to-speech software.
• Building an electronic artefact such as a model for Minecraft or similar games, along the lines of the United Nations Block
by Block project.
This should not only describe what the project would be, but also why you think it is important or interesting, and what potential drawbacks or obstacles you anticipate.
The project idea that you put forward should have elements of originality and innovation, it does not have to be re- inventing the wheel - but isn’t to be cloning an existing product or service and doing a minor change.
Note: There are to be significant tangible artifacts towards the project completion that are delivered by the submission of ASSIGNMENT 3, so keep this in mind when brainstorming your IT Project Idea – Feasibility is a key factor.
There isn’t a set expectation of complexity to the project you select and explore, and it doesn’t necessarily have to be something commercially viable, but, perhaps aiming for such could help you settle certain questions or help form your own (and tutors/graders) perspectives towards it.
Your description should include the following sections. The word counts below are recommendations only not absolutes but are a good guide of a minimum.
Overview (100 words) - This should be a summary of what the project will be.
Motivation (100) words) - This should be a description of why the project will be interesting or useful. This may include statistics or other evidence, such as: "There
service. are 1.5 billion cat owners in Australia, and so there is a huge market for an automated cat feeder. Using Raspberry Pi technology is a cheap and easily assembled solution to this problem."
Description (500 words) - Detailed description of the features of the product or service
Tools and Technologies (100) words) - Describe the software, hardware and/or other equipment needed. Include
any relevant open source tools as appropriate.
Skills Required (100 words) - List the skills are required for your project, including software that needs to be written, and special hardware (if any). How feasible will it be to find the skills, software and hardware required?
Outcome (100  words) - If the project is successful, what will be the outcome? How will the original problem be solved? What impact will this development have?</p>
