<p> 16 Personalities Test Results -  <a href=" https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/bbfcb1c71575d" target=>16Personalities test Link</a> </p> 
<p> Learning Test Results -  <a href=" http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=6&V=7&T=7" target=>Learning Style Results Link</a></p>
<p> The Big Five Test - <a href=" https://www.understandmyself.com/Contents/Item/Display/1437866" target=>The BIg Five Test Link</a> </p>


<p> The results mean for me i can take a look inside my personality, it is goodo for not just potential employers to know me and my personality but for me to understand who i am. Understanding myself wether in personal business or learning situations is valuable in mainatining control and being aware of my potential flaws. </P>

<p> The results influence my behaivior in a team by bringing my attention to my behaviours and likely responses to other personalities. By identifying my strengths and weaknesses i can see what area of the team i should be in, e.g. if i should be a leader and take charge or am i better to sit back and observe more. It definatley helps with conflict resolution or at least avoidance, knowing i may not be assertive enough, like in my case. 
The tests show me i should speak up more and not sit on my hands. If i feel or see something i dont agree with i should be aware i am a go with the tide guy and i need to action. 

I should take this into account when forming a team by finding alternative people who are strong where i am week and or opposing strengths, so we can have a even strong team. If we all have the same strengths there are many gaps in our team, if there is someone better at certain traits they should be in the position to use them. 


<h4>Overview of the project. </h4>
I am excited about the idea of creating a piece of software that I am yet to see in the market.  This application will allow users to link their Netflix account with their social media contacts.  Once a user watches or starts watching program on Netflix the user will be able to review that program for their friends to see. 
In the case you are unsure what to watch you can check what your friends have liked and not liked. Obviously, there is already recommendations by Netflix on there, but it would be amazing to read the reviews of your mates who have similar taste. E.g., John likes zombie movies, I find a zombie move I am about to watch, John said it was a 1/5 ill pass on it and find another as I trust my mateâ€™s reviews more than random key words like zombie in the Netflix algorithm.

<br> </br>
<h4>Why?</h4>
This is new to the market; I canâ€™t see any competition directly with us. New things are exciting right? To lead the way in innovation in something I am passionate about (watching TV ðŸ˜Š) All jokes aside its exiting to me as I can see a large area a lot of people waist time and time is money so with this tech, we are saving a ton of time in a huge market. This is not a small market we are attacking. 203.67 million paid subscribers are on Netflix. Scrolling and scrolling wanting to find something interesting to watch. The scope of business and innovation here is whatâ€™s exciting to me. 
<br> </br>
<h4>Motivation.</h4>
45 hours per year on average people spend just deciding what to watch. I know in my world I invest way too much time deciding what to watch, then when I decide you must give that show a period of time to see if it is great, bad and possibly gets better or not. So, the total time investing in finding a poor quality tv show and watching it to see if it gets any better is huge.  It would be super beneficial to glance at a page to see what my mate thought of the show and make the decision instantly. I personally have mates who we just get a long based on liking the same sort of shows. If I could see his reviews that would be very beneficial. Also, I have mated the other way who I canâ€™t trust their opinion on shows as they have different prospective, either way it helps me decide. 
<br> </br>
<h4>Description. </h4>
The software I would love to engineer is a simple platform on the user front but may be a bit more complicated back end I assume. The software will allow users their own portal, in that portal they would be able to log in from their device weather phone or computer, I feel a web portal is sufficient although an app would be beneficial, I can see people more hesitant to install apps. Hence the web portal would suffice. 
In this portal you will have the opportunity to link your social media, email & or phone contacts to your profile. The software will display the Netflix shows and your contacts review on those shows. 
There will be two avenues to read your contacts reviews. 
Via Netflix show & Via username. 

 - Via Netflix show
This page will list all the shows in a graph, this graph will be set to show highest rating first. This page has the ability to average the star rating from your contacts to list the Netflix shows in assumed preference according to my social circle.  Example is the software computes all the ratings in my friendâ€™s circle and averages them out into the spreadsheet. There is a toggle on/off Favorite person button on this page also. 
 If no one has reviewed a show its at the bottom equal to not having many stars.  If many of my friends like a show it is pushed up the list.  Like what google does with business reviews, the greater number of positive reviews the higher the ranking. 
This page will be good if your unsure what to watch you can check highest ranked show and whack it on the tv. 

- Via username
In the case you have the one mate like John above who I know I love his taste in shows I can click his name and see the list of his reviews. There will be a basic adjustable graph that lists. 
A, Show name
B, Genre 
C, Date reviewed
D Star rating 
C comments. 
Each column the user will be able to toggle priority of the column and there will be a search feature. The search would be active in all columns. E.g., I love sci fi so I might search sci fi then toggle the star rating set to highest rating first. That way it will show me the most relevant items to what I am wanting to watch. 
This page is good if you have that epic mate like John who you love his shows and trust his reviews. 
<br> </br>
<h4>Weight of friend. </h4>
In the case like my situation, you have two friends who you can/canâ€™t trust reviews you can mark one friend as a favorite, increasing the weight of their reviews. 

Backend we would need a super admin portal where we can see all the data input by users, this will be useful for IT support or issues, tracking usage and selling data to advertising *permitted by user of course in T&C ðŸ˜Š
<br> </br>
<h4>Tools and Technologies </h4>
This is my first IT education course and itâ€™s the first module, so I have not had a huge amount of exposure to the IT world although I will answer to what I believe.
As the only tool I have used so far, I would assume GitHub would be the facilitator of the code. 
Code & skills would need to be. 
HTML for the basic page listings skills
CSS for the design of the pages
Java for the features and automations and complicated coding. 
API from Netflix to tap into their database. 
Amazon AWS to store our user data. 
Domain name and hosting 
Google business email addresses
Business phone numbers for IT support and sales. 
At this stage its free although down the line there will be use for stripe invoices for payments of upgraded features. 
Itâ€™s a complete soft solution so no need for hardware. 
Skill breakdown HTML, CSS, Java, researching Netflix API, SMM marketing, Domain acquisition, AWS and cloud server, customer relations, Tech support, ASIC business submission, ABN/trading name acquisition and maintenance, people & team management, Tax lodgment and BAS submissions & finally Staff management once we have a team of full timers. 

<br> </br>
<h4>Competition,</h4>
There is not a direct competitor that I can find searching online. The closest competition would be blog posts like the Top 10 Netflix shows to watch or google searching Netflix best sci fi show. I cannot find anything that links with people you trust and getting their reviews. They are all one persons point of views or a group of people the blogger has questioned. 
<br> </br>
<h4>Hurdles, </h4>
Potential hurdles I can foresee currently, API from Netflix, they may not want to release their data on what their users are watching. If this is the case, we will just need to list all shows on Netflix rather then just the ones that the users contacts have watched. In the Via show column. If they give us the data, our system will be up to date with newest shows. If they wonâ€™t let us have an API then we will need to extract from a database which may not be from the source and not as updated as ideally as we would like. 
Marketing, getting the software into peopleâ€™s hands, making them aware. Word of mouth would be excellent. How the app signal handles it is great, where you are notified when your contact installs the same app. 
That builds confidence. 
<br> </br>
<h4>Outcome</h4>
The outcome would be an ideal scenario for end users to have quick and easy reference to what to watch without the endless scrolling through Netflix. Business outcome is we will have a large amount of data that we can on sell to advertising companies.  Ideal outcome would be Netflix purchase our system to integrate with their portal so users can do it all from their tv without logging into our system.
